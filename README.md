# BootcampQuiz
The goal of this project was to create a quiz using everything I learned about Javascript, HTML and CSS. The design of this website was to give a multiple choice quiz to the user who can then see their score after taking it. The user can also view past high scores as well as play the game again without refreshing the page.

## User Story
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Usage
Upon landing on the page the user will be able to click View High Scores and Hit the start quiz button. When the user clicks view high scores the text will change to go back which will lead them back to the home page. 

When the user clicks on start quiz the quiz will then begin and the user will have to answer 5 questions regarding Javascript and CSS.
